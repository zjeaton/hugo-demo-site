# Hugo Demo Site

A quick site built with Hugo, to demonstrate gists that I have written for Hugo. At creation there is only one gist, a modal image pop-up. 

## Modal Image Popup

Demo of the image popup. For info on how to install, [check out the Gist](https://gist.github.com/zjeaton/0cdd7e4bed9d292ab6f3d76b0369f16d).
