![happy cat on its back with eyes closed](smiling-cat.jpg#float-right)

This is a demo of the functionality of the modal image pop-up that I wrote. If you would like the code for it, [head to the gist](https://gist.github.com/zjeaton/0cdd7e4bed9d292ab6f3d76b0369f16d). Code placement is explained there.  

One feature of this gist is the ability to use a hashtag with the image filename, which allows for css styling. The image to the right of this paragraph was placed using this: `![happy cat on its back with eyes closed](smiling-cat.jpg#float-right)`
